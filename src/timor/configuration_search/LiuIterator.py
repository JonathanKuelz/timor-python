    This iterator returns assemblies according to the criteria defined in the paper:

      "Effortless creation of safe robots from timor.Modules through self-programming and self-verification"
      by M. Althoff, A. Giusti, S.B. Liu, A.Pereira,
      https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1506779/gy8gyea2c5vyn65ely4bnzom6.Althoff-2019-ScienceRobotics.pdf

    Iteration happens in a depth-first manner, iterating over links the fastest, then joint combinations, then
    end-effectors and slowest over bases.

    This class is named after the author who initially came up with the idea of the here implemented search space
    reduction, Stefan Liu.

    The following constraints reduce the search space of possible assemblies:
      - The robot is a serial chain of modules. Every module has a proximal (=female) and a distal (=male) connector.
      - A maximum number of degrees of freedom (default: 6)
      - There are never two joints mounted directly after one another
      - There is a maximum of three static links in between two joints
      - The first module must be a joint module (this is not explicitly mentioned in the paper but can be derived from
        the modules they used)
      - The last module before the end-effector must be a joint. This can theoretically be relaxed in the future.
