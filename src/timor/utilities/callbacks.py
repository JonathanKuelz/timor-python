    This Enum can be used by iterative algorithms to give feedback to the caller about the status of the algorithm.
    It's values can be interpreted as follows:

        * TRUE: The callback was evaluated without any problems and the algorithm should continue.
        * FALSE: The callback detected a problem (e.g., a constraint violation) that can potentially be resolved in
            future iterations. However, the current state is not considered valid/successful.
        * BREAK: The callback detected a problem that cannot be resolved in future iterations. Interrupt the algorithm.
